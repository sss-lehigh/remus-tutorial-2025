# Remus Documentation

This folder has the necessary infrastructure for creating Remus
documentation.  There are currently two kinds of documentation:

1. A "Remus Usage Tutorial".  This is in the `tutorial/` folder, and consists
   of a markdown-based `vitepress` website.
2. "API Documentation".  This is automatically generated via doxygen.  The
   necessary configuration files can be found in the `doxygen` folder, along
   with a `Makefile` to help with building the documentation.
