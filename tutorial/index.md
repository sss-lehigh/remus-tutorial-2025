# Welcome

We're glad you are interested in using Remus.  Above, you can find a link to the
Remus Tutorial.  Eventually, we'll have a link to doxygen output here, and a
link to slides from the introductory portion of the tutorial.

If you're developing tutorial material, and don't know much about markdown, then
the "VitePress Markdown Guide" might be helpful.  It's going to go away
eventually, so make sure you learn all that you need before it's too late.

Note: Right now we're using the default styling.  Eventually we should go with
something more Lehigh-specific, and more SSS-specific.  That's going to be a bit
tricky, since we also want to support dark mode, so let's not worry about it
yet.
