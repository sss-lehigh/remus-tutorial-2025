## Tutorial Repository

- Are we going to have a branch where all the steps are completed?
  - Each step as a branch

## Day Of Tutorial

- We need participant cloudlab configuration!
- Are we assigning three nodes per participant?
  - Two nodes per person... gotta change that.

We aren't going to release python scripts or anything like that.

Web SSH support and ssh key setup too (with one ssh key pair all set up).

github: we want a sss-lehigh/remus-tutorial-2025

- two blank branches, one for docs, one for source code

## Doxygen

- Content: probably finished "for the most part"
- Appearance: does not look pretty yet.  Alex will try to use doxygen-awesome to
  make it better.
